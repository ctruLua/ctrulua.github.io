  <h1>What is ctrµLua?</h1>
  <p>ctrµLua, note the case, is, as you can deduce, a Lua parser for 3DS. It's born within the <a href="http://microlua.xooit.fr">µLua community</a> as an attempt to bring their favorite piece of software to the 3DS. The result ended being mighty different from what was µLua itself.</p>

  <h1>What can it do?</h1>
  <p>You'll have to ask the guys at development. Or check the <a href="https://github.com/ctruLua/ctruLua/wiki">TODO list</a> on GitHub. Most of the features we wanted are in, there may be a few bugfixes left to do though.</p>

  <h1>What about the lads that made it? - Organization members</h1>

  <h2><a href="https://github.com/Firew0lf">Firew0lf</a></h2>
  <p>We're... pretty sure he's a huge nerd. No, more like nerd king. He's one of the two developers on the project, and probably the one most eager to expand it. He also goes by geeker <span style="font-size: 10px;">and I personally believe he must be yelling at all times IRL</span>.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://github.com/Reuh">Reuh</a></h2>
  <p>Same, a developer. Pretty mature and really silent<span style="font-size: 10px;">, I mean it, sometimes I wonder if he died in front of his screen</span>. Also probably a nerd.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://github.com/NegiAD">Negi</a></h2>
  <p>Loud-mouthed and pretty much useless. He did the <span style="font-size: 10px;">shitty</span> icon. A giga-nerd <span style="font-size: 10px;">and self-proclaimed "community"-manager because no one takes care of this damned website and because it's fun</span>. He never participates in code and unintentionally got credited.</p>
